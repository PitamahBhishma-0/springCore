ATTENTION !!!!!

PLEASE READ THE THEORY PART BEFORE ACTUALLY SEEING THIS CODE OR U WILL GO TO COMA (Just kidding).

Hello, this is my bunch of practice code in spring may it help u understand a little bit of core spring.

EACH CODE HAS IT'S OWN EXPLANATION. PACKAGES ARE THERE TO DISTINGUISH THE TOPIC IN SPRING CORE.

I will add explanation to every code inside (until i feel lazy doing that). I hope u guys will understand it.
