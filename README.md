ATTENTION !!!!!

PLEASE READ THE THEORY PART BEFORE ACTUALLY SEEING THIS CODE OR U WILL GO TO COMA (Just kidding).

I HAVE ADDED "description.txt" inside of every packages so that u guys can understand what is going in the packages.

AND config file of each packages are different with the same name of packages (eg: bean_IOC) for spring.IOC package and
so on.

Hello, this is my bunch of practice code in spring may it help u understand a little bit of core spring.

EACH CODE HAS IT'S OWN EXPLANATION. PACKAGES ARE THERE TO DISTINGUISH THE TOPIC IN SPRING CORE.

I will add explanation to every code inside (until i feel lazy doing that). I hope u guys will understand it.
