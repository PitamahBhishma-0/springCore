Here I have discussed mainly 3 types of autowiring. The description of each type is given in config file outside the packages.

Here I have taken Human class as dependent to Heart and I am performing DI in Human class. Where Body class is my test class.

There are 2 methods of autowiring 
  a)On config file
  b)On JAVA side using @Autowire
    --- IN THIS byType is resolved first than byName 
    
    AUTOWIRE NOT POSSIBLE FOR PRIMITIVE AND STRING DATA TYPES, BECAUSE HOW CAN A SPRING KNOW MY INDIVIDUAL DATA I HAVE TO ENTER.
    
    
    
    WHEN WE HAVE MULTIPLE OBJECT FOR SAME CLASS SPRING CANNOT CONFIGURE ITSELF SO WE PROVIDE @Qualifier Annotation helping implementing byType
    autowiring.
    
    For example we have 2 human and octupus heart and the spring fails to create the object because it is confused to configure which type.
    So in Human class to implement the Human heart I have used @Qualifier(id_name). to make spring easy.
