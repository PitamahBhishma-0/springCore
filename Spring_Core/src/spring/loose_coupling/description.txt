//  CODE EXPLANATION
LEARNING THEORY IS IMPORTANT.



Here i have assumed that a student is dependent on cheating in every exam. So I have made a interface called cheat so that it 
it supports every cheating in  exam. While this  I have to make only one interface(cheat) that can implement many subjects
(classes) in it. And when ever the student want to cheat in additional subjects he only have to implement the cheat interface.
And we can only add beans of different subjects(classes) to make student cheat the different subject withoiut changing code.


Thus from here we can find loose coupling achieved between STUDENT CLASS AND CHEAT INTERFACE through interface type.
