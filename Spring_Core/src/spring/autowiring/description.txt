Here I have discussed mainly 3 types of autowiring. The description of each type is given in config file outside the packages.

Here I have taken Human class as dependent to Heart and I am performing DI in Human class. Where Body class is my test class.

There are 2 methods of autowiring 
  a)On config file
  b)On JAVA side using @Autowire
    --- IN THIS byType is resolved first than byName
